   <h3>A Little Insight</h3>
   <p> I'm currently a senior at UA Little Rock. I am majoring in International Business and I'm minoring in Information Technology. </p>
   <p> Along with school, I was able to intern and work for Just Communities of Arkansas. A non-profit that dedicates its time to facilitate tough converstions in our community that lead to equity and inclusion.</p>
   <p>During my time studying my major, minor and working at JCA, I've learned to adapt and improve my critical/analytical skills. I got to learn the culture of a business, domestically and globally,technical skills; Microsoft, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, etc;the importance of problem solving, and adapt the way I communicate with various people.  </p>
   <p>I hope to have the opportunity to have a career in an environment that allows me to apply what I've learned, and get the chance to improve them.

  <h3>Cover Letter</h3>
  <p>I grew up in a household that holds sincerity, respect, and family as pillars of success. Sincerity is defined as being true to yourself and making sure that the image you portray is what others see.</p>
  <p>I portray sincerity through being an open book, being dedicated for what I believe in, and making sure that the image of who I am, stays steady in all encounters.</p>
    <p>Respect is something that everybody knows about. Respect for me is not only addressing and treating others as they want to be treated, but it’s about having respect for yourself, owning up to your actions, and going beyond when needed. To have respect for yourself, you need to identify your boundaries and ideals, and stick with them; not allow others to influence your decisions. This trickles down to identifying your faults, and then taking the initiative to fix them. Respect also identifies as knowing your responsibilities. Once you’ve established them, it then carries on to making sure that they are done well, and that one is constantly looking for ways to improve the process of them to create a more effective environment for all.</p>
    <p>Growing up in a Hispanic household, Family was, and still is, crucial. It’s the root of all the motivation and dedication I have with anything I do. I believe creating a sense of family in any environment will allow people to thrive, give them confidence to reach for higher goals, and create a bravery to face all obstacles. The reason behind that being, you will always have someone to confide in and give the support people don’t realize they need.</p>
    <p>Being a college graduate may seem that I don’t have any experience, but I make sure that when I’m put in any position or assigned any task, I try my best to master the skills required, and even then research many other ways to develop an outcome that maximizes benefits for any party involved. With that said, I may be rough around the edges, but I don’t shy from challenges.</p>

It was up to us to create the HTML, CSS, and other elements within our website. I chose to create a website of off the Space X Dragon spaceship. A cool thing about this project is that I had to learn how to optimize and edit images. I showed these skills by changing the outline and color scheme of the Dragon Logo. I came into the course with no knowledge about what HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc consisted of. This project, being my first attempt to make a full website, had a great outcome.</li>
